A CLI expense tracker.

## ðŸ“š Basic Knowledge

| Every debit needs a credit.

It's no secret that this project is inspired by 
[GNUCash](https://www.gnucash.org/). I learned from there what is a 
[Double-entry bookkeeping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-entry_bookkeeping).
To undestand in a fast way, you can watch this
[youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EibibVFEkvk) from
[The Finance Storyteller](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheFinanceStoryteller).

With this information you should understand better how the double-entry
bookkepping works. At least the necessary to start. ðŸ‘Œ

## ðŸ¤” How to use?

The application consists in four entities, the [books](#book),
[accounts](#account), [transactions](#transaction), and [splits](#split).

Basically you have a book with diverses accounts that have the values changed
by the transactions, that creates at least two splits. Is it better? ðŸ˜…

### Book

Main object containing all historic.

### Account

The account can be a subaccount, every account is from a super account, those are:

| Account Type | Description                          |
